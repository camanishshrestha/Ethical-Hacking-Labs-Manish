## Detailed Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Network Scanning & Enumeration with Nmap
I performed network scanning and enumeration using Nmap on Kali Linux. Tasks included basic network scans, port-specific scans, service version detection, OS detection, and aggressive scanning. This project helped me understand how to identify devices and vulnerabilities in a network.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, Nmap  
**Skills:** Network scanning, enumeration, vulnerability identification

---

### Project 2: Penetration Testing OWASP Juice Shop
I conducted penetration testing on the OWASP Juice Shop, a vulnerable web application. I exploited SQL Injection, XSS, file upload vulnerabilities, directory traversal, and CSRF attacks to understand common web application weaknesses.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, OWASP Juice Shop, Burp Suite  
**Skills:** Web application testing, vulnerability exploitation, ethical hacking

---

### Project 3: Password Cracking with John the Ripper
I used John the Ripper to crack password hashes, including shadow files. Tasks included basic password cracking, custom wordlists, incremental brute-force, and rule-based cracking. This highlighted the importance of strong passwords and secure hashing.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, John the Ripper  
**Skills:** Password security analysis, hash cracking, brute-force techniques

---

### Project 4: Honeypot Deployment with Cowrie
I deployed and monitored a Cowrie honeypot to capture and analyze malicious activity. The logs were forwarded to Splunk for alerting, reporting, and visualization. This project taught me how to use honeypots for security research.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, Cowrie, Docker, Splunk  
**Skills:** Honeypot setup, log analysis, security monitoring, SIEM integration

---

### Project 5: Auditing & Attacking Wi-Fi Networks with Aircrack-ng
I audited Wi-Fi networks using Aircrack-ng, capturing handshake packets and cracking WEP/WPA/WPA2 passwords. Packet analysis with Wireshark helped me understand network vulnerabilities and improve wireless security.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, Aircrack-ng, Wireshark  
**Skills:** Wireless network auditing, handshake capture, password cracking

---

### Project 6: Phishing Simulation & Defense with Gophish
I created phishing campaigns using Gophish, captured user interactions, and analyzed the results. I also implemented defensive measures like user education, email filtering, and multi-factor authentication to reduce risks.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, Gophish, Web Server  
**Skills:** Social engineering, phishing simulation, cybersecurity awareness

---

### Project 7: SQL Injection Exploitation & Defense on DVWA
I exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities on DVWA manually and with SQLMap, extracting database information. I then applied secure coding practices, input validation, and least privilege principles to mitigate SQL injection risks.

**Tools:** Kali Linux, DVWA, SQLMap, MySQL, Burp Suite  
**Skills:** SQL injection exploitation, database security, web application defense
